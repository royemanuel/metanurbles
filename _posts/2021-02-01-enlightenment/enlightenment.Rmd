*Enlightenment is man's release from his self-incurred
 tutelage. Tutelage is man's inability to make use of his
 understanding without direction from another. Self-incurred is this
 tutelage when its cause lies not in lack of reason but in lack of
 resolution and courage to use it without direction from
 another.* **Sapere aude! 'Have courage to use your own reason!'**- *that is
 the motto of enlightenment*

I found this quote by Immanuel Kant on a college football blog,
[CornNation](https://www.cornnation.com/2021/1/19/22238660/hey-rube). The
quote resonates because at times I am happy to lead others or to be
lead by others. Happy to blaze my own trail or allow inertia to place
me where it will.
